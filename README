Temporary-ish for Allen's reference
inputdata.h5 is mock data from running dummy_data/data_scripts/mk_data.py with 2_exp.
The important dimensions of the data are that it has:
2 parameters
2 observables
42 MC runs
20 bins (per observable, although there could be different numbers of bins)

I still want to stick with this for testing over the new real data because it has two parameters instead of one,
which can help catch issues in the code. I don't how much you need to understand the h5 file to do your task, but
h5_test.ipynb is a start; there are also vscode extensions which will display the values of h5 files.
